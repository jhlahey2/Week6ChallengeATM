Week 6 Challenge: First Spring Application (ATM)

Due Friday by 5:01pm Points 100 Submitting a website url Available after Oct 25 at 8:30am

Write an Spring Boot application simulating a ATM at a bank.

The application should allow people to make a deposit or a withdrawal with a form and show their transaction history,

along with their balance.

So, you will need the following pages:

    deposit form
    withdrawal form
    transaction history page

For your model, you will need

Transaction

    id #(autoincrement)
    accountNumber #
    action (withdrawal or deposit)
    amount
    reason

The users will not login, they will just enter in their accountNumber number (we are very trusting here at SpringBoot Bank.

Optional, but recommended: If you finish this early then please stay a while and continue working on the other
assignments in the SpringBoot packets which you may have missed up to and including all of Lesson 3 (Database Relationships).
